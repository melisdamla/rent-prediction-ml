# Rent Prediction ML Web App

This project is a full-stack machine learning application designed to predict rental prices per square meter (`loyer_m2`) in France. It integrates data preprocessing, regression model training and evaluation, and a Flask-based web interface to serve real-time predictions.

---

## 🚀 Features

- End-to-end ML pipeline: from raw data to deployed model
- Multiple model training: Linear Regression, Lasso, Random Forest, XGBoost
- Preprocessing with imputation, scaling, and one-hot encoding
- Model evaluation using MAE, RMSE, and R²
- Web form interface with dropdowns based on training data
- Confidence intervals computed from model residuals
- Docker support for reproducibility and deployment

## 🧪 Getting Started

### 1. Install Dependencies

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### 2. Train and Evaluate Models

```bash
python script/evaluate_models.py
```

This will train and evaluate multiple models, then save the best one as `models/best_model.pkl`.

### 3. Launch the Web App

```bash
cd flask_app
python app.py
```

Visit `http://localhost:5000` to access the form interface and make predictions.

---

## 🐳 Docker (Optional)

To containerize the application:

```bash
docker build -t rent-predictor .
docker run -p 5000:5000 rent-predictor
```

With Docker Compose:

```bash
docker-compose up --build
```

---

## 🧠 Model Details

The application evaluates the following regressors:

- Linear Regression
- Lasso
- Random Forest Regressor
- XGBoost Regressor

Each model is wrapped in a Scikit-learn `Pipeline` including:

- `SimpleImputer` for missing values
- `StandardScaler` for numeric features
- `OneHotEncoder` for categorical variables
- `ColumnTransformer` to apply preprocessing in parallel

The model with the lowest **RMSE** is selected and saved.

---

## 🌐 Web Interface

The Flask app provides:

- An HTML form for inputting housing features
- Dynamic dropdowns populated from training data
- Real-time rent prediction with 95% confidence interval

**Example Output**:

```
Prédiction estimée : 12.4 €/m²
Intervalle de confiance : [10.7 – 14.1]
```

---

## 🔭 Future Improvements

- REST API for programmatic access
- File upload for batch prediction
- Deployment to cloud platforms (e.g., GCP, Heroku, Render)
- Interactive map of predicted rents by region
